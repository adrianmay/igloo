Central Heating Controller on Raspberry Pi (like nest and hive, only better)

This heating controller consists of:
* A RPi with WiFi and a small PSU in the box where the thermostat used to be. 
* Lots of LM35 thermometers in different rooms, in the garden and behind radiators, dangled along some alarm wire.
* Some programming ingenuity
